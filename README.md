ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hassannaghibi, I have more than 7 years of professional experience as a Software Engineer. In these years I developed and supported many projects as a software engineer. Iâ€™m familiar with cloud stacks like GCP and AWS, Also I have experience in microservice architecture and worked with Kubernetes and docker-compose in my projects.
AI and Machine Learning are two important concepts that Iâ€™m familiar with and I like to follow some projects in these fields too.
Iâ€™m adaptable, cooperative, creative, focused, and organised and I like new challenges.
