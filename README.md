ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @hassannaghibi, I have more than 7 years of experience as a Software Engineer. In these years I developed many web platforms as a backend engineer. Also, Iâ€™m familiar with microservice architecture and I worked with Kubernetes and docker-compose in my projects. Python and Javascript are my passions and I like to work in these fields.
AI and Machine Learning are two important concepts that Iâ€™m familiar with and I like to follow some projects in these fields too.
Iâ€™m adaptable, cooperative, creative, focused, and organized and I like challenges.
